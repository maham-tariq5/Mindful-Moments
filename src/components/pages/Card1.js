          <h3 className="chapterTitle">Chapter 1 Green Light</h3>
          <p>
            We broke up a month ago, and I'm feeling all these emotions now. 
            When you said we were over for good this time, 
            it felt like I was in a fever dream, 
            unable to comprehend the words that came out of your mouth. 
            I tend to suppress my emotions, ignore the signs, 
            and try to move on from experiences like these. 
            I don't know how to feel at all; I'm just a 19-year-old girl trying to imagine my life without you. 
            You were the first significant other I ever had, the first person who loved me for my good traits and bad. 
            You held my hand through my mid-adolescence and cared for me during my lowest points.
          </p>
          <p>
            I left my apartment at 9:00 pm and went on a nighttime walk to let out all these emotions. 
            Before leaving, I put on my favorite short pink dress, straightened my hair, and applied some makeup. 
            I took out my iPhone, put in my earbuds, and played my favorite breakup songs at full volume. 
            Five minutes into the walk, I started crying; my mascara ran down my cheeks. 
            I knew this might happen, so I brought tissues in my purse just in case. 
            I started dancing on the sidewalk, letting out all the energy in my heart. 
            At one point, I even danced on the road but quickly got off because of the cars. 
            I just need some sign from the universe to move on from this experience. 
            I'm waiting for it, that green light—I want it.
          </p>

          <h3 className="chapterTitle">Chapter 2: Sober</h3>
          <p>
            My friend Albert told me that I need to move on from the breakup. 
            He suggested that we throw a house party to forget about my heartbreak and live a little. 
            We contacted everyone we knew, and they all agreed. 
            I really needed this party to distract myself from all the emotions I was feeling. 
            It was now 9:30 pm on a Saturday evening, and the hot summer breeze was blowing. 
            People started arriving, and the DJ played a bunch of dance music to set the vibe. 
            I was drinking with my mates but didn’t want to get too drunk, as the night was still young.
          </p>
          <p>
            There was one guy I saw from across the room. 
            I couldn’t seem to look away and was mesmerized by his pearly white smile. 
            We started talking and had a few shots together. 
            He made me laugh for the first time in a month, and we danced together a bit. 
            It felt good to let loose. 
            My only concern was: what would we do when we’re sober?
          </p>

          <h3 className="chapterTitle">Chapter 3: Homemade Dynamite</h3>
          <p>
            The night went on as I danced to the beat of the music. I had been holding this guy's hand throughout the night. 
            I was having the time of my life and felt happier than ever for once. 
            Everybody was happy, smiling, and a few were puking because they had a little too much to drink. 
            It started getting dark outside, so I had to turn on more lights around the house. 
            The vibe of the party in the backyard was surreal: there were bright blue lights, a blue-tinted pool, 
            and people dancing with their significant others. 
            Our friends, our drinks, we felt inspired, blowing up shit with homemade dynamite.
          </p>

          <h3 className="chapterTitle">Chapter 4: The Louvre</h3>
          <p>
            It was getting later and later as the party went on. I felt a strange instinct coming into my head that I couldn’t shake off. 
            I started thinking about my ex again and how this new guy is the complete opposite of him, and actually likes the beach. 
            Am I just wasting his time to fill an empty void of mine? Does that make me selfish? 
            I feel like I am, and that I’m just using him for my own enjoyment. 
            My empathetic side started kicking in, and I wouldn’t want to be treated this way if I were him. 
            What if I’m just chasing this euphoric feeling that this guy is giving me? 
            In the end, all I can think about is how we’re the greatest and they’ll hang us in the Louvre.
          </p>

          <h3 className="chapterTitle">Chapter 5: Liability</h3>
          <p>
            I had a sudden rush of sadness that hit me, and I felt like crying. 
            I went to my bedroom to get my thoughts back in check. 
            I started having flashbacks of the night I was broken up with. 
            I was in the taxi, crying as I tried to process the news I had been hit with. 
            Apparently, I’m a storm, and he made the mistake of dancing in it. 
            That night, I realized that no one can love me the way I want them to. 
            I need to be the best version of myself before I give in to someone else. 
            I came into this world alone, and I’m going to leave it alone, so I might as well enjoy my own company. 
            I haven’t opened up to anyone about these feelings because I feel like a burden. 
            I think I’m a little too much for people; I’m a liability.
          </p>

          <h3 className="chapterTitle">Chapter 6: Hard Feelings</h3>
          <p>
            I wasn’t ready to go back downstairs and enjoy the party just yet. I wanted to stay in my dark room a little longer. 
            I lit all the candles and set up the flowers I had bought for my room. 
            I care for myself the way I used to care about him. I know it’s a hard pill to swallow, but we were bound to end. 
            Our love had turned into a ghost as we sat in his car. I always felt a rush whenever I was with him, 
            especially when we drifted while buying groceries. He was my lover, but I had outgrown him—the whole world knew except for me. 
            These are what they call hard feelings.
          </p>

          <h3 className="chapterTitle">Chapter 7: Loveless</h3>
          <p>
            I headed back downstairs as the party was still going on. My emotions were back in check, and the guy I was with all night had already left the party. 
            All of my friends were still there, so we decided to end the night on a high note. 
            Albert found an old tape lying around and asked me what it was. I answered that I was unsure. 
            We gave the DJ the tape and told him to play it; it had a little note on it that said “this is my favorite tape,” so we assumed it would be upbeat. 
            A hip-hop beat started playing, and it was very groovy to dance to. We all chanted, “L-O-V-E-L-E-S-S generation.”
          </p>

          <h3 className="chapterTitle">Chapter 8: Sober II (Melodrama)</h3>
          <p>
            The party was finally over, and it was about 3 am. I’m glad I took Albert’s advice and threw the party. 
            I felt like a whole different person today, and I hope I continue to feel this way. 
            Everyone was gone, and I was left alone to clean up the mess that had been created. 
            It’s crazy how fast the evening and night pass while you’re having fun. 
            I was cleaning up the champagne glasses while staring at the backyard and seeing all the trash. 
            I guess this is what they call melodrama.
          </p>

          <h3 className="chapterTitle">Chapter 9: Writer in the Dark</h3>
          <p>
            I open up my journal and write down how I feel every morning so I can slowly overcome these emotions. 
            I remember him breaking the news to me and leaving me in pieces as he calmly walked out. 
            I bet he has moved on and found someone better, someone who is good enough for him. 
            Even though our love died, I will still love him until his breathing stops. 
            I’ll find a way to be without him, even in my darkest hours. Breakups can be a hard thing for a person to go through. 
            For me, it was a completely new concept, as he was my first significant other. 
            It’s sad knowing that the person you spend every waking moment with can leave your life in the blink of an eye. 
            At the end of the day, that’s life. You’re going to have many people walking out on you; all you can do is move on and find your destiny in this cruel world. 
            One thing I’m always going to remember is that I’m a writer in the dark.
          </p>

          <h3 className="chapterTitle">Chapter 10: Supercut</h3>
          <p>
            In my head, all I can replay are the good memories I have left of him: all the magic we shared and the love we had and lost. 
            I remember us being in his car, trying to talk about our relationship, but the radio was too loud. 
            All these clips replay in my head over and over again, and I end up ignoring what reality actually is. 
            I remember traveling the world and how being so far apart from him was hard; long distance isn’t easy at all. 
            I was performing on stages and meeting new people while he was in my hometown taking pictures. 
            In my head, I did everything right, or at least I thought I did, which I clearly didn’t from his perspective. 
            In the end, it’s just a supercut of us.
          </p>

          <h3 className="chapterTitle">Chapter 11: Liability Reprise</h3>
          <p>
            I think it was the party that made me feel like a liability, to be honest. 
            Maybe the point of the party was for me to get sad and cry. 
            I feel like I’m not the problem anymore; it’s just the feeling that the party gave me that made me think I was. 
            I guess what I thought I was is not what I actually am. 
            I kept playing the villain card and made myself believe that I was the bad guy, but in reality, no one is. 
            I guess I’m not actually a liability.
          </p>

          <h3 className="chapterTitle">Chapter 12: Perfect Places</h3>
          <p>
            Drinking, partying, and doing drugs are common activities among teenagers and young adults. 
            When you're a child, you think the world is like a fairy tale and everything is perfect, 
            but as you get older, you start to see the bigger picture. 
            I am not the same person I was when I was 16 years old. 
            Back then, I was filled with angst, felt like a gladiator, and thought I was unstoppable. 
            As I grew older, I soon realized that I was just a little fish in this big ocean. 
            I was hit with all these new emotions, responsibilities, and more.
          </p>
          <p>
            As young adults, we are still navigating our experiences and finding ourselves. 
            Some of us feel like we have no purpose in this world and use party culture to distract our minds from real-world problems. 
            I am definitely someone who has done this, and I'm not very proud of it. 
            I'm not saying you shouldn’t live out your youth and party, but don’t make it the center of your life. 
            You should have goals, work hard, and have big plans, but don’t ignore those important things for parties.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can go anywhere in the world to distract your brain from issues in your life, but in reality, there is no perfect place that exists. 
            After the hangover hits or the drugs wear off, you're back in the same shitty state you were in before. 
            All those nights spent off our faces, trying to find these perfect places—what the fuck are perfect places, anyway?
