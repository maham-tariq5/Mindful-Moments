        How many times have you felt like a failure in a depressive slump looking for the light but stuck in the darkness? 
        I’ve felt like this countless times in my life wondering “am I not working hard enough”, 
        “are others smarter then me” “do I even deserve it” etc. 
        Looking for the answers to those questions always kept me overthinking wondering what side of the road I was on. 
        I turned off all the distractions around on me and locked all my negative thoughts away and channeled positivity inside my brain. 
        When you tell yourself countless times “I’m not capable of this” “what’s even the point no one will care” you will never succeed and the darkness will win. 
        By shifting my outlook to a mindset of "I don't know how, but I will," I transformed my life. 
        Although it may sound clichéd, maintaining a positive mindset, especially when facing adversity, is essential. 
        Rejection is merely redirection toward what is truly meant for us. 
        Embracing patience in the process is crucial, for patience is indeed a virtue.
